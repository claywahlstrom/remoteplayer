# Remote Player

## Description

Flask Web App for playing music from your phone or desktop. You don't even have to be in the room!! Just start the server, connect to it's ip-port combo on your browser, and post URLs away!

A laptop and an aux cord work best for your stereo setup, and a mobile phone works great for sending music URLs to your server (includes YouTube(tm) pages).

## New features
Playlist functionality now added: includes adding songs to the queue, skipping the current song

## Disclaimer

Currently only configured for Google Chrome when it's your default browser. Also, the server only works on your local network and only if you are connected to WiFi.

## Requires

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)

[pack](https://github.com/claywahlstrom/pack.git)


## Easiest way to run the server
```
python app.py
```

## Future
A better UI
